## History

I wrote the original zoneplate code as part af my first undergrad internship at CRC _circa 1986_.

My task was to implement these test patterns as part of a video signal processing research group.

This was my first introduction to conics. The patterns generalize to conic sections or projections:

The original implementation was written in Fortran on a DEC LSI-11 (64kB of memory).
It was also ported to:

- Original `Fortran` version is _lost_, writtten _circa 1986_
- Ported to `C++` at CRC _circa 1996_
- Static image/video generation in Go _circa 2015_
- For this experiment, re-implemented in JavaScript, Rust and Go.
  Both Rust and Go versions compiled to Webassembly

I later joined the group at CRC permanently.
