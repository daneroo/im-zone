## What's a Zone Plate?

<img style={{ width: '400px' }} src="https://zone.v.daneroo.com/api/zone/" />

---

## How do you make one?

<Equation coefs={{ cx2:1, cy2:1, ct:0 }} />
<br />
<pre>
  pixel(<em>x,y</em>) = ~cos(z)
  <br />
  &forall; <em>x,y</em> in the image
</pre>

Which is convenient, 'cause it's a reasonable amount of simple computation

---

> We developed 3 implementations of the generator;
> in JavaScript, Rust and Go, the latter two were compiled to WebAssembly.
>
> <cite>Me</cite>

---

> We scoped the experiment around a suitable computational problem - Visual Pattern Generation,
> which also leverages the strengths of Next.js as a developer and deployment environment.
