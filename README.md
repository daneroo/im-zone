# Zone plate generation

- [Deployed as a Next.js (w/Rust/WASM) site](https://zone.v.imetrical.com/)
- Next.js - WASM - Rust - Go: `./nextjs-wasm-rust/`
- Go version, static cli, and WASM, working, not yet integrated into next app.
- Static image/video generation in Go: `./static-go/`
- Original `C++` code from CRC in `./legacy-CRC/` *circa 1996*
- Original `Fortran` version: *lost*, but if I had it, I would dockerize it!

## TODO

- deploy to vercel with build
  - lerna - split go and rust into packages and publish
  - [microbundle](https://buttercms.com/blog/nextjs-storybook-and-lerna-build-a-monorepo-structure)
  - [rollup and wasm-pack](https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust)
  - [rust-webpack-template](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template)
  - pika pack - @pika/plugin-wasm-bindings , https://www.pika.dev/blog/introducing-pika-pack/
  - page for api/routes
  - api route for add and stamp
  - api route for for go/wasm
- [next-mdx-deck](https://github.com/whoisryosuke/next-mdx-deck)
- measure performance without/less annotations, or without impact..
- Go: try to find a zero allocation model (especially for tinyGo)
  - go still allocates the array, and the copies it into the passed Uint8ClampedArray
  - Replace wasm_exec with ... a real module
  - [webpack go loader npm](https://github.com/aaronpowell/webpack-golang-wasm-async-loader)
  - [webpack go loader blog](https://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2019-02-12-golang-wasm-6-typescript-react/)
- Exploit symmetry in zone plates
- Content
  - History add scans and pictures
  - Add performance comparative benchmarks (lik in WASM Go README)
    - pub-sub in nats?

## Usage with lerna

```bash
lerna bootstrap
lerna run dev --parallel

lerna run test

# example new package
lerna create --private render-js
# adjust names and  entrypoint:dist/index.js
cd packages/render-js && npm i -D microbundle standard jest
```

Add `package.json` targets:

```json
"source": "lib/index.js",
"scripts": {
   ..
   "dev": "microbundle watch --jsx React.createElement"
 },
  "jest": {
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "branches": 0,
        "functions": 0,
        "lines": 0,
        "statements": 0
      }
    }
  },
  "standard": {
    "//parser": "babel-eslint",
    "env": {
      "jest": true
    }
  },
```

### Front end

```bash
cd packages
npx create-next-app
cd front-end
lerna add render-js
```

## History

I first wrote this code as part af my first undergrad internship at CRC.
My task was to implement these test patterns as part of a video signal processing research group. The original implementation was written in Fortran on a DEC LSI-11 (64kB of memory).

This was my first introduction to conics. The patterns generalize to conic sections or projections:

When I joined the group,..
