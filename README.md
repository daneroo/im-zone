# Zone plate generation

- [Deployed as a Next.js (w/Rust/WASM) site](https://zone.v.imetrical.com/)
- Next.js - WASM - Rust: `./nextjs-wasm-rust/`
- Go version, static cli, and WASM, working, not yet integrated into next app.
- Static image/video generation in Go: `./static-go/`
- Original `C++` code from CRC in `./legacy-CRC/` *circa 1996*
- Original `Fortran` version: *lost*, but if I had it, I would dockerize it!

## TODO

- Buffered frames - RAF is unreliable?
- Allocate mem in Rust (@gcouprie): <https://www.hellorust.com/demos/canvas/index.html>
- Styling (Layout and refactor COntrols)
- Exploit symmetry in zone plates
- Add performance comparative benchmarks (lik in WASM Go README)
- History (with scans and pictures)

## History

I first wrote this code as part af my first undergrad internship at CRC.
My task was to implement these test patterns as part of a video signal processing research group. The original implementation was written in Fortran on a DEC LSI-11 (64kB of memory).

This was my first introduction to conics. The patterns generalize to conic sections or projections:

When I joined the group,..
