## History

I first wrote this code as part af my first undergrad internship at CRC.

My task was to implement these test patterns as part of a video signal processing research group.


This was my first introduction to conics. The patterns generalize to conic sections or projections:

The original implementation was written in Fortran on a DEC LSI-11 (64kB of memory).
It was also ported to:
- Original `Fortran` version is *lost*, writtten *circa 1986*
- Ported to `C++` at CRC *circa 1996*
- Static image/video generation in Go *circa 2015*
- For this experiment, re-implemented in JavaScript, Rust and Go. 
Both Rust and Go versions compiled to Webassembly

When I joined the group,..
